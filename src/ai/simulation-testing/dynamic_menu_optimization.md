# AI-Driven Dynamic Menu Optimization System

## Overview

This document outlines the design for an intelligent system that dynamically optimizes menus based on user preferences, dietary restrictions, and business requirements. The system will continuously learn from user behavior and feedback to improve menu compliance while balancing cost, sustainability, and other business metrics.

## Core Components

### 1. Dynamic Preference Learning Engine

- **User Preference Tracking**: Continuously monitors and analyzes user selections, rejections, and feedback
- **Preference Clustering**: Groups users with similar preferences to identify emerging dietary patterns
- **Trend Detection**: Identifies seasonal and temporal trends in food preferences
- **Feedback Loop**: Incorporates explicit user ratings and comments to refine preference models

### 2. Menu Optimization Algorithm

- **Multi-objective Optimization**: Balances competing goals (cost, nutrition, sustainability, preference compliance)
- **Constraint Satisfaction**: Ensures all hard constraints (allergies, dietary restrictions) are met
- **Soft Constraint Weighting**: Prioritizes soft constraints based on business rules and user importance
- **Simulation-Based Testing**: Tests proposed menus against simulated user populations before deployment

### 3. Admin Preferences Control Panel

- **Parameter Adjustment Interface**: Allows administrators to modify system parameters
- **Impact Prediction**: Shows real-time projections of how changes will affect key metrics
- **Scenario Comparison**: Enables side-by-side comparison of different parameter sets
- **Override Controls**: Provides manual override capabilities for special circumstances

### 4. Reporting and Analytics Dashboard

- **Compliance Metrics**: Tracks how well menus meet various dietary preferences and restrictions
- **Financial Impact Analysis**: Shows cost implications of menu changes
- **Sustainability Metrics**: Displays CO2 footprint, organic percentage, and other environmental factors
- **User Satisfaction Tracking**: Monitors attendance rates and feedback scores

## Admin Module: Preferences Updating Function

### Interface Design

The admin module will include a new "Menu Optimization Parameters" section with the following features:

#### 1. Parameter Control Panel

- **Cost Controls**:
  - Adjust target cost per portion (with percentage or absolute values)
  - Set maximum cost thresholds for different meal categories
  - Configure volume discount targets and supplier negotiation goals

- **Sustainability Controls**:
  - Set minimum organic percentage targets
  - Adjust maximum CO2 footprint thresholds
  - Configure local sourcing percentage goals

- **Supplier Management**:
  - Include/exclude specific suppliers
  - Include/exclude ingredients from specific countries
  - Set preferred supplier weightings

- **Dietary Compliance Controls**:
  - Adjust minimum number of options for each dietary restriction
  - Set compliance priority weights for different restrictions
  - Configure allergen avoidance strategies

#### 2. Impact Prediction Panel

When parameters are adjusted, the system will run simulations and display projected impacts on:

- **Financial Metrics**:
  - Average cost per meal
  - Total monthly food cost
  - Projected supplier rebates and volume discounts
  - Cost variance across meal categories

- **Sustainability Metrics**:
  - Average CO2 footprint
  - Organic ingredient percentage
  - Food waste projections
  - Local sourcing percentage

- **User Experience Metrics**:
  - Projected attendance rates
  - Dietary restriction compliance percentages
  - Estimated user satisfaction scores
  - Menu variety and repetition statistics

- **Operational Metrics**:
  - Supplier diversity
  - Ingredient availability risks
  - Seasonal adjustment requirements
  - Special equipment or preparation needs

#### 3. Scenario Management

- Save multiple parameter sets as named scenarios
- Compare scenarios side-by-side
- Schedule scenario activation for specific date ranges
- Create conditional scenarios that activate based on triggers (e.g., ingredient price changes)
