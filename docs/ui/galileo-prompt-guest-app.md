# Galileo Prompt for Kanteeno Guest App UI

Create a clean, modern mobile app interface for a canteen management app called "Kanteeno" with the following key screens:

## 1. Weekly Menu & Attendance Screen
Design a weekly calendar view showing Monday through Friday with the following elements:
- Each day displays 3 meal options in a horizontal row
- For each meal option, show:
  - A small, appetizing food photo (square format)
  - The dish name in bold text
  - 2-3 allergen icons below the dish name (gluten, nuts, dairy, etc.)
  - A subtle eco-indicator showing sustainability (green leaf for vegetarian, etc.)
  - A clear selection state (highlighted border when tapped)
- At the bottom of the screen, include a prominent "Submit Weekly Selections" button
- The design should make it obvious that tapping a meal equals reporting attendance for that day

## 2. Special Produce Section
Design a scrollable grid of special discounted produce items with:
- Card-based layout with 2 items per row
- Each card showing:
  - A photo of the produce item
  - A prominent discount badge (e.g., "30% OFF")
  - Product name and brief description
  - Expiration date in a subtle but clear format
  - "Add" button or icon

## 3. User Profile Screen
Design a simple profile screen with:
- User avatar and name at the top
- Dietary preferences section with toggle switches
- Order history section showing past selections
- A simple impact statistics section showing food waste reduction

## 4. Order Confirmation Screen
Design a clean order confirmation screen with:
- Selected meal with image
- Pickup information (time, location)
- QR code or barcode for verification
- Order details summary

The overall style should be:
- Clean and minimalist with ample white space
- Use a fresh color palette with greens and earth tones
- Clear typography with good hierarchy
- Intuitive icons and visual cues
- Accessible design with good contrast

Focus especially on making the weekly menu selection process intuitive, as this is the core functionality where users both view the menu and report their attendance by selecting meals.
